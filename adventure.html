			    <img class="pictures" id="gorilla" src="images/gorilla.jpeg">
			    <p id="gor"> It’s very possible to get a smidge of primatologist Jane Goodall’s experience
					without making gorillas your life’s work. On Abercrombie & Kent’s 5-day Tailor-
					Made Uganda: Bwindi Impenetrable Forest journey, you’ll pick your adventure
					pleasure, whether you want to penetrate the lush-beyond-belief Bwindi
					“Impenetrable” Forest National Park in search of its resident tribes of gorillas, or
					tour the children’s wing at the local community hospital with A&K Philanthropy.
					When you see your first gorilla, remember it’s not King Kong: gorillas are typically
					sweet-tempered, even a bit bashful.
